According to GetFive, only 30% of resumes are approved by applicant tracking systems (ATS). Once the resumes are approved, a hiring manager will only spend an average of six seconds reading each resume.

To help you showcase your personality in that 6 seconds , we have got 'Growth' for you.
'Growth' is the web application which helps students to get their resume in hand just by filling up a simple form where important credentials like skills, education, experience and achievements need to be filled. 
The resume is downloadable in pdf and word format.
 Growth is different from any other resume building website because we offer the user to choose from hundreds of free, designer-made templates and to choose from any company based template. 
Now you can simply make any resume by using only keywords. 
We can drop the documents from LinkedIn and then our AI will extract the information to generate the personalized format.
We also provide the user with feature of paraphrasing and getting suggestions for his resume.
